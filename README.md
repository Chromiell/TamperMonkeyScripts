# Italian Form Filler & Codice Fiscale Generator

A lightweight Tampermonkey userscript designed for developers and QA engineers to instantly fill web forms with realistic, synchronized Italian test data.

With a simple **double-click** on any visible input field, it automatically populates names, surnames, emails, dates of birth, gender, and—most importantly—a **mathematically valid Italian Codice Fiscale (Fiscal Code)** that perfectly matches the generated identity's details to bypass strict form validators.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Valid Codice Fiscale Calculation:** Automatically computes the exact 16-character alphanumeric string, including the correct mathematical checksum letter (CIN).
- **Multi-Form & Anti-Duplication:** Built-in smart grouping recognizes row-based layouts or multi-passenger forms (e.g., `passenger_0`, `passenger_1`) and generates completely unique identities for each block instead of pasting the same data everywhere.
- **Context-Aware Mapping:** Populates adjoined fields such as Name, Surname, Email, Birthplace, and Gender automatically if they are present in the form layout.
- **Safe Testing:** Skips hidden tracking/anti-bot fields (`display: none` / `visibility: hidden`) and preserves fields you have already typed in manually.
- **Modern Framework Support:** Triggers native input and change events to play nice with React, Vue, Angular, and Svelte forms.
