# Italian Form Filler, Codice Fiscale & Partita IVA Generator

A lightweight Tampermonkey userscript designed for developers and QA engineers to instantly fill web forms with realistic, synchronized Italian test data.

With a simple **double-click** on any visible input field, it automatically populates names, surnames, emails, phone numbers, localized addresses, and—most importantly—perfectly synchronized legal identifiers to bypass strict form validators.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Valid Codice Fiscale Calculation:** Automatically computes the exact 16-character alphanumeric string, including the correct mathematical checksum letter (CIN) based on the generated name, surname, gender, and birthplace.
- **Valid Partita IVA Generation:** Generates a formally correct 11-digit Italian VAT number, complete with valid provincial office identifiers and a mathematically correct Luhn-like control digit.
- **Coordinated Geographic & Address Data:** Generates realistic street addresses (e.g., _Via Aldo Moro 31_) tightly synchronized with a real Italian City, its matching 2-letter Province abbreviation (e.g., `MI`, `RM`), and the exact valid 5-digit CAP (ZIP code) to satisfy strict cross-referenced location checkers.
- **Robust Semantic Intelligence:** Evaluates actual on-screen labels and adjacent hints. Includes strict boundary logic (such as `\bvat\b` regex filtering) to prevent false positives like mistaking the word `"privato"` for a VAT field, and cross-exclusions to prevent postal address rules from hijacking email inputs that mention the phrase _"email address"_.
- **Multi-Form & Anti-Duplication:** Built-in smart grouping recognizes row-based layouts or multi-passenger forms (e.g., `passenger_0`, `passenger_1`) and generates completely unique, internally consistent identities for each block instead of pasting the same data everywhere.
- **Safe Testing:** Skips hidden tracking/anti-bot fields (`display: none` / `visibility: hidden`) and preserves fields you have already typed in manually.
- **Modern Framework Support:** Triggers native input and change events to play nice with React, Vue, Angular, and Svelte forms.
